# weather-prediction-app
The NOAA has hosted hourly weather data including air temperature measurements for multiple different stations around the world. The different stations can be downloaded at: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-hourly/access/2023/?C=S;O=D

For this demonstration application, the 99999927516.csv was used containing data from a station in Alaska.

This csv was uploaded to a local MongoDB using PyMongo and the following:

```
python upload_csv_files.py -db_name noaa_global_hourly -col_name wp_app -csv_dir /ml_projects/weather-prediction-app/noaa_data/
```
The default host name of localhost:27017 will be used, if a different one is desired, change by setting -hostname argument of upload_csv_files.py

Each row in the CSV file contains data for roughly every 5 minutes, and the temperature reading has various quality control checks.

PyMongo was used in order to filter for missing temperature values or temperature values with undesirable quality control flags:

```
python create_dataset.py -save_path /ml_projects/weather-prediction-app/raw_dataset.json
```

The above code will create a JSON file dictated by -save_path where the keys are timestamps and the values are temperature values.

These raw data are normalized and made seasonal stationary with:

```
python process_dataset.py
```


In the MySQL terminal:
```
mysql --local_infile=1 -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE weather_prediction;
USE weather_prediction;
source C:/path/to/load_combined.sql
```
In order to inspect the model performance:
```
source C:/path/to/describe_performance.sql
```
